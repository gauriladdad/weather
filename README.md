==============Project description==============

This is application to get weather data of a particular location selected on world map.
A particular location can be found by zooming/pinching into/selecting a location onto the map. The app will default
to a city closer to the center of the map.

The weather information will contain - City name, temparature and short description (like partly cloudy or snow or so).

==============Test==============
I have used XCode to test this application.
